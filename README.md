SNAKE GAME

OVERVIEW

Retro Snake Game application built entirely with HTML, CSS, and Vinilla Javascript.
Have fun playing the original snake game with all of the core functionality from the game we all know and love!
Utilized setInterval() and HTML <canvas> to create a retro snake game.

SUMMARY

This project was pretty challenging for my logic and problem solving skills. For the first time I familiarized myself with Canvas element and the extensive ways 
this feature can be used. I started the game by breaking it down into multiple functions, where each task was responsible for a specific game functionality. Then 
one main function was implemented to call all those functions through setInterval() method. Also used for the first time array.unshift() method to help grow the 
body of the snake, and array.splice() to bring the snake to its initial body shape when Game Over. To start the game, the user has to press TAB key or any arrow 
key. The snake will grow every time it eats an apple. If the snake reaches the edge of the Canvas - itâ€™s Game Over, as well as if it bumps into himself. The game 
can be played as many times as the user desires. A score count will be displayed on top of the canvas.
